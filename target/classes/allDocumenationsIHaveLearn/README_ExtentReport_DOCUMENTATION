		-> EXTENT REPORT are used to create testing reports.
		Such as test success rate, failure rate, who did the test
		and a well organised html report.
		
		
		To use EXTENT REPORT in our project.
	
	1)	 create a maven project with
	 the following rules.
	 
	 	i) File -> New-> Other-> Maven -> Maven Project
		
	   ii) Next->Next-> search with anyone of this following
	   		make sure they are same.
	   		
	  iii) "org.apache.maven.archetypes" "maven-archetype-quickstart"
	  
	   iv) Next-> provide a group id which is the  package name and
	   		an artifact id (Project name) .	
	   		
	   	v) click on "Finish".
	   	
	   	
	   	2) SELENIUM & TESTNG DEPENDEPCY: -
		
		 vi) Now, go to the project and you will see a file name 
			"pom.xml"
			
		vii) Now inside the "pom.xml" file just right above the "build" tag, 
			 create a "dependencies" tag. Then inside the tag we need to
			  put 2 dependencies one for "selenium" & one for "TestNG".
			
		viii) SELENIUM:- "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java"
			Copy and paste the latest dependency inside the 
			xml file. This is for SELENIUM
			
		  ix) TESTNG :- "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng"
			Copy and paste the latest dependency inside the 
			xml file. This is for TESTNG
			
		  x)  Extent Report :- "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/
		  com.aventstack/extentreports/3.0.0"
		   copy and paste the extent report dependency inside the 
		   pom.xml.
		   
		  
		  3) Now, to use the Extent report , let's create a method
		  	inside the method lets declare two important class which 
		  	are "ExtentReports" & "ExtentSparkReporter"
		  	
		  	
		  	
		  	---------------------------------
		  	
		  	String path = System.getProperty("user.dir")+
		  	"/reports/index.html";
		  	ExtentSparkReporter report = new ExtentSparkReporter();
		  	
		  	--------------------------------
		  	
		  	xi) Here , the "path" variable, getProperty creates a path
		  	automatically inside the "projectName/reports/index.html"
		  	suppose other developer may have different project name. 
		  	They might want to create an extent report. Those time
		  	this will create a folder name reports and a file name 
		  	index.html inside that project for that developer.
		  	
		  	Now,
		  	
		  	-> this class is responsible to driver all the report 
		  	execution
				-------------------------------
				extent = new ExtentReports();
		  	
		  	----------------------------------
