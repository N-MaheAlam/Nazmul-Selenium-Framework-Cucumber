1)	Download the AutoIt in your system.
2)	Open the auto it file , there is a script writing I mean editor
	& a tool to track the box or anything which gives, the path like 
	a chropath or selector hub in selenium.
	
	There is a a lot of windows in a computer like browsers, eclipse,
	many other applications windows. So, we have to tell the AutoIT
	to Focus on file uploading window.
	
	i)	To give control in auto it write
	
		-- ControlFocus("Open", "" , "Edit1")------
		
		we will get this from the tracker. "Edit1" is "class" and 
		"instance" combination which is displayed in tracker.
		
	ii) Now, we have to give the path of the exact file which we
		want to upload.
		
		----ControlSetText("Open","Edit1"."Path of the file")-----
	
	iii)  This command is to  click on the upload or open button.
		  
	----ControlClick("Open","","Button1")------
	 
	 iv) Now save the file and then compile it , it will be converted
	 	 into an ".exe" file.
	 	 
	 	 [ Remember , for window uploading use 
	 	 
	 	 "http:username:password@URLOfWebsite". For file uploading
	 	 we don't have anyother options but AUTOIT]
	 	 
	 v) Now Write down the selenium code then when we need to call
	 the file 
	 use the below code to call the file 
	--- "Runtime.getRunTime.exce("Path of that file");--------
