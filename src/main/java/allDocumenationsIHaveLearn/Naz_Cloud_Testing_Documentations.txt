			CLOUD TESTING
			
=>	Cilent wants to test his/her tests in a firefox version which
	is not available in my company so those time should test 
	my selenium code in a cloud where other people hosts the version
	that I want.
	
	
	-> For cloud testing we can use the sauce lab web site to test 
		our selenium codes. Let's register there and check
		
		
		
		We need to know about "Desired Capabilities" class. This 
		class connects the cloud and our selenium code. and in 
		cloud virtual machine, we can provide the informations 
		such weather I want to run in windows or mac or linux and 
		there versions. Which broswer and version I want to run 
		I can provide all these details.
		
		1) To set the capabilities we can use a web site which will 
		give use automatic capabilities to run the test for OS
		versions and browsers versions.
		
		2) We normally used WebDriver d = new ChromeDriver();
		
		But  as our test will not be performed in our machine. we
		should provide RemoteWebDriver() instead of ChromeDriver()
		or firefoxDriver() etc.
		
		
		
		So,
		
		i) set desired capabilties
		ii) set remote driver and its URL and capability argument
		iii) bring the user name and access key and code from souce
		lab. 
		iv) run the test from your machine and check it in sauce lab 
		web site.
