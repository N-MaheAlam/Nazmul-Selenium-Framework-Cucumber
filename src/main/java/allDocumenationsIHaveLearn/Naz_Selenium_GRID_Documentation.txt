		 					"SELENIUM GRID"
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	- [ ] Selenium grid is nothing but running test in multiple 
		 	machine parallel.


			- Client:- is nothing but our selenium raw code . Like local machine
			
			- Router :- request from client will go to the router. From router 
			it will be directed to the distributor who is nothing but reads the 
			code and properties to direct code into the exact node (machine). 
			
			The distributor will send request to node to execute the code. 
			When distributor send request to nodes to perform a task which 
			has come from client , distributor will send the session details to
			 session maps like session id and node details. So, now client send 
			 first line of code through router , and distributor and found out 
			 the node. So, if the code for the same test is sent by the client 
			 , router will now talk to the session map and will look for the 
			 session id and node. When router gets, then is it passes code 
			 directly to the nodes. Distributor is used only for the first 
			 time to create a session for a test. 
			 
			 
			 LECTURE 224 :-
			 
			 "SELENIUM GRID INSTALLATION"
			 
			1)  Download Selenium Grid jar and place it where I have kept
			 the drivers like chrome driver, gecko driver. 
			
			2) open the terminal from that folder and in terminal write
			
			--- java -jar selenium-server-4.3.0.jar hub ------
			
			 -> Now, at the end you will see 
			 	"Started Selenium Hub 4.3.0"
			 	-> Now, go to "http://localhost:4444/ui" you will see a 
			 	Selenium Grid Page 

		 [Hub and node can be same system which is that when hub receives 
		  request it will assign to your machine as it is also a node]
		  
		  3) Now , open a new tab from terminal and put the below code
		  to start your machine as a node also 
		  
		  --java -jar selenium-server-4.3.0.jar node --detect-drivers true---
		  
		  This command starts the machine as node and gives the path of drivers
		  make sure the drivers and selenium server is in same folder.
		   
		   	GO to http://localhost:4444/ui you will see the difference
		   	
		   	
		   	LECTURE 225 :-
		   	
		   	"SELENIUM GRID in different machine as node"
		   	
		   	To use other machines as node. 
		   	 
		   	 i) Make sure you installed all the browsers on that particular 
		   	 machine.
		   	 
		   	 ii) Make sure you put all the drivers and selenium  server jar
		   	 	in the same folder.
		   	 	
		   	 	
		   	 	1) Go to the command prompt of that machine and go inside the
		   	 		folder and run the same "node" command
		   	 		
		   â€¢ Start the Node in different Physical Machine : -
		   -----------------------------------
			java -jar <SeleniumJarname> node --detect-drivers true 
			-- publish-events tcp://<ipaddressofhub> --subscribe-events 
			tcp:// <ipaddressofhub>
			---------------------------------
		   
		   => Version of selenium server can be different 		
		   	 	 
		   	 	 2) Now, we need to register new node to our hub machine.
		   	 	  There are two events publish events and subscribe events.
		   	 	  
		   	 	  -> In hub there is "XPUB" binding is 4442 and XSUB binding 
		   	 	  is 4443. 
		   	 	  -> IP address is in the last in hub terminal
		   	 	  -> So according to my system if I rewrite the code it will be
		   	 	  like  
		   	 	 
		   	 	 -----------------------------------
			java -jar selenium-server-4.3.0.jar node --detect-drivers true 
			-- publish-events tcp://192.168.2.15:4442 --subscribe-events 
			tcp://192.168.2.15:4443
			---------------------------------
		   	 	 
		   	 	 
		   	 	 LECTURE 226 :- 
		   	 	 
		   	
		   	Now, write selenium code then go through the below processes 
		   	
		   	-> Create a new java project and add 
		   	"Java build path -> class path -> add external jars -> 
		   	add the selenium server jar and apply it.
		   	
		   	Now, go to the "Naz_Selenium_GRID_LECTURE_222_TO_227" project 
		   	see the definitions of the classes and comments then you will under
		   	stand.
		   	
		   
		   -> Make sure you convert the project in TestNG and parallel mode is 
		    in "classes"	 as we have two classes on that package and we want 
		    to run two classes parallel.
		   
		   -> Remove (.) dot from class names in testng.xml file as the classes 
		   	 now in default folder.
		   
		   REMEBER :- 
		   In real time what people do
		   
		   	i) All the hub processes can be in one machine
		   	ii) eclipse java code (client) can be one machine
		   	iii) they create multiple nodes 	 
		   	 	 
		  -> No matter from which machine you are running your tests, you are
		  asking to reach the IP address [new URL("http://192.168.2.15:4444")] in
		   RemoteWebDriver class. So, it doesn't matter your hub and actual 
		   client (selenium code) is the same machine.
